*Principal Investigator*

I work as an associate professor at at TCG CREST, Kolkata, India. My undergraduate training was in Computer Science and Engineering, and later I moved on to study Computational Neuroscience at the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), TIFR, Bangalore, for my PhD. There I worked on computational modeling of biological neural networks, developing a simulator for biology research, and developing data and model description formats.

I did my postdoctoral research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda. I learnt electrophysiology, microscopy, and other techniques and carried out animal experiments to study the sense of smell. I combined computational modeling with experiments to answer fundamental questions in neural information processing.

I am primarily interested in biological intelligence, though I utilize artificial intelligence as a useful tool. I also develop software to facilitate research.
