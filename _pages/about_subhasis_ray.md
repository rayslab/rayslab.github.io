**Subhasis Ray**

*Principal Investigator*

Currently I work at Plaksha University, India, as an Assistant Professor. My undergraduate training was in Computer Science and Engineering, and later I worked on Computational Neuroscience at NCBS, TIFR, Bangalore for my PhD. There I worked on computational modeling of biological neural networks, developing a simulator for biology research, and developing data and model description formats.

After obtaining my PhD, I joined the NIH, Bethesda for my Postdoctoral research. There I conducted electrophysiological and behavioral experiments on animal models, and combined experimental results with computational modeling to answer fundamental questions in neural information processing.

At present I am interested in studying how sensory inputs and experience control behavior in animals. I am also interested in developing software for biology research, and in applications of Artificial Intelligence in biology.
