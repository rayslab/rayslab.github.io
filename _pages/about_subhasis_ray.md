*Principal Investigator*

I work as an Associate Professor at CHINTA, TCG CREST, Kolkata, India. After earning a B.E. degree in Computer Science and Engineering, I worked as a software engineer for a couple of years. I then moved on to study Computational Neuroscience at the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), TIFR, Bangalore, where I obtained a PhD in Biology. There, I worked on computational modeling of biological neural networks, developing a simulator for biology research, and developing data and model description formats.

I conducted my postdoctoral research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, where I learnt electrophysiology, microscopy, and other techniques, and carried out animal experiments to study the sense of smell. My research there combined computational modeling with experiments to answer fundamental questions in neural information processing.

I am primarily interested in biological intelligence, though I also use artificial intelligence as a valuable tool. I also develop software to facilitate scientific research and education.
