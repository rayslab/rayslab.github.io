*Summer Student*

I am currently pursuing my MSc in Physics at Ramakrishna Mission Residential College. Alongside my studies, I have a deep interest in neuroscience, with a particular focus on understanding consciousness. This interdisciplinary curiosity drives my academic and personal endeavors. In my leisure time, I find enjoyment in playing chess and creating content for YouTube.
