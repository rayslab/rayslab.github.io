*Project Assistant*

Jyotirmay Srivastava is a Neuroscience Researcher and holds a Master of Science (MS) by Research degree in Biological Sciences from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Thiruvananthapuram (IISER Tvm). At CHINTA, he is investigating the neuronal basis of multisensory integration in insects, using cockroaches as a model organism. His work combines behavioural neuroscience approaches with electrophysiology to explore how these systems function.

His prior research at IISER Thiruvananthapuram focused on neurodegenerative disorders. He developed and worked with chronic mouse models of Parkinson's disease to investigate molecular pathology and assess potential therapeutics. Complementing this experimental work, he also developed computational tools that use deep learning to automate and deepen the analysis of complex behavioural data, providing more objective and nuanced insights into motor function.

When he's not in the lab, Jyotirmay enjoys exploring different kinds of worlds through books and film. He is often found deep in a fantasy or philosophy book and is a huge fan of captivating science fiction shows and movies. This love for exploring new ideas, whether in a distant galaxy or a philosophical text, is fueled by the same curiosity that drives his scientific work, a constant desire to understand how complex systems, and the stories within them, are built.
