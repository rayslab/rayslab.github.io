**Prashant Tiwari**

*Undergraduate Student*


I'm Prashant Tiwari, hailing from a farming background. Nature captivates me, seen in my love for mango orchards and vast farmlands. Understanding the behavior of living beings is my research passion. I seek to understand their survival tactics, family dynamics, and food acquisition. Solving real-life challenges using technology intrigues me too: earthquakes, irrigation, pollution, energy, and transportation. In my free time, I explore the past's mysteries, play sports, create videos, write, and venture into new territories. My curiosity knows no bounds - I'm driven to unravel nature's enigmas.
