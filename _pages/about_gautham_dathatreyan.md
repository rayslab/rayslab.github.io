**Gautham Dathatreyan**

*Project Assistant*

Gautham completed his Integrated Master's in Physics from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore Campus. His passion for computational neuroscience and interdisciplinary research led him to pursue his master's thesis at the Amrita Mind Brain Center. There, he worked on the automated reduction of complex, multicompartmental biophysical neuron models, including cerebellar neurons, into simpler spiking neuron models. This work aimed to optimize computational efficiency, enabling the simulation of large-scale neuronal networks for behavioural modelling and analysis.


At CHINTA, TCG CREST, Gautham is currently modelling neurons using MOOSE. His research focuses on understanding the brain's information-processing mechanisms during navigation by leveraging computational tools and neuroscience principles.


Gautham is excited by the opportunity to engage in interdisciplinary research and enjoys learning about how things work across various fields while staying updated on developments in the tech and scientific industries. Outside of his academic and professional life, Gautham enjoys watching movies, using his free time to relax and unwind, and spending time with friends.
