*Software Engineer for MOOSE*

I am a Frontend Software Engineer at Moose, where I build fast, accessible, and scalable web interfaces that power meaningful user experiences. Specializing in JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, and modern frontend tooling, I turn complex problems into elegant, maintainable solutions.

For MOOSE, I focus on crafting UI systems that are not only performant but also thoughtfully designed, bridging the gap between engineering and design. With a strong eye for detail and a passion for clean code, I help shape products that are intuitive, responsive, and built to last.

I'm particularly interested in how technology can enhance scientific discovery, especially in understanding the brain through modeling and simulation. My broader interests include component-based frontend architecture, web performance optimization, and user-centered design.
