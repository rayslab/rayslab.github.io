**Harshpreet Kaur**

*PhD Student*

I'm Harshpreet Kaur, a postgraduate in Biophysics Honours, I am on an exciting odyssey of self-exploration, in pursuit of the boundless mysteries that science has to offer. During my research endeavours, I have become particularly fascinated by neurological studies with their potential applications in addressing and tracking animal behaviours, associated diseases and challenges. In my free time, I like cooking, playing sports, drawing, writing, and volunteering in outreach programs. My journey in neuroscience has just begun, and the crescendo of discovery awaits.
