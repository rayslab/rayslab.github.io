*Summer Student*

I am an undergraduate student at Ashoka University, pursuing Psychology and Biology. I am interested in exploring various aspects of neuroscience and cognitive psychology such as sleep, memory, language, plasticity, neurodegeneration and traumatic brain injury. When not pursuing my academic interests, I enjoy reading, cycling, and music.
