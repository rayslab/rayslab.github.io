*Technical Writer for MOOSE*

I hail from a mathematical background with interest in applying my skills to solving interdisciplinary problems. I completed B.Sc. in mathematics followed by an M.Sc. in mathematics from IIT Madras and an M.Sc. in pure mathematics from UWO, Canada. I was curious and interested in interdisciplinary research options and had embarked upon a very exciting journey of a PhD student under the EuroSPIN programme at NCBS Bangalore and KTH, Stockholm, which got discontinued. After a career break, I worked as a scientific writing intern for a short while and have currently joined as technical writer for MOOSE at CHINTA. I enjoy reading, watching movies and listening to music.
