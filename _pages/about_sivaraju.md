**Sivaraju**

*Post-doctoral Researcher*

I completed Integrated MSc in Systems Biology and PhD from the University of Hyderabad. During my PhD in Neuronal Systems Lab (https://sites.google.com/site/nsyslabcncs), I characterised the visual systems of Hieroglyphus banian (Rice grasshopper) using bulk tracing, immuno-histochemistry and electrophysiology techniques.

Here at CHINTA, I work as a Postdoc in Ray's lab. We are trying to understand multisensory processing in the cockroach *Periplaneta americana*. 

During my free time I prefer exploring new places. I am a bird enthusiast, I carry a pair of binoculars with me everywhere to look around for birds.
