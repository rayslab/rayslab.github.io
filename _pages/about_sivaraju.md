**Sivaraju**

*Post-doctoral Researcher*

I completed Integrate MSc in Systems Biology, and PhD from the University of Hyderabad. During my PhD in Neuronal Systems Lab (https://sites.google.com/site/nsyslabcncs), I characterised the visual systems of Hieroglyphus banian (Rice grasshopper) using bulk tracing, immuno-histochemistry and electrophysiology techniques.

Here at CHINTA, I work as a Postdoc in Ray's lab. We are trying to understand the multisensory processing in *Periplaneta americana* (Cockroach). 

During my free time I prefer exploring new places. I am a bird enthusiast, I carry a pair of binoculars with me everywhere to look around for the birds.
