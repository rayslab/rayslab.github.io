**Shagun Rana**

*Research Fellow*

Hello, I'm Shagun, a postgraduate in Computer Science and Information Security. Currently, I am on an exciting journey of exploration, trying to discover my research interest. Recently, I have developed a growing fascination with neuroscience and find myself drawn to the idea of merging it with principles of computer vision. I strongly believe in the power of simplicity and always strive to make the most out of less. I am truly excited about the possibilities that lie ahead on this exploration, and look forward to the challenges and discoveries that await me.|
