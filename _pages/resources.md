## on artificial neural networks
### Books
  * [Raul Rojas' book on Neural Networks](https://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/inst/ag-ki/rojas_home/documents/1996/NeuralNetworks/neuron.pdf) - the PDF is transient. Here is [google books link](https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Neural_Networks.html?id=txsjjYzFJS4C&redir_esc=y)
  * [Neural Networks and Deep Learning - free online book by Michael Nielsen](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html)
  * [Hacker's guide to Neural Networks by Andrej Karpathy, back when he was a PhD student](https://karpathy.github.io/neuralnets/)
  * [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/)
  * [Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
  * [Sanjeev Arora's book draft at Princeton](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall19/cos597B/lecnotes/bookdraft.pdf) - this is heavy on the math

### Course materials
  * [Standford course CS224d: Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/index.html)
  * [Stanford course CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition course notes](https://cs231n.github.io/)
  * [CS 285 at UC Berkeley](https://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/)
  * [David silver lectures](https://www.davidsilver.uk/teaching/)
  * [Exam notes by Martin Thoma (partly in German)](https://martin-thoma.com/neuronale-netze-vorlesung/)

### Blogs/podcasts
  * [Andrej Karpathy's blog](https://karpathy.github.io/)
  * [Podcast episode on Reinforcement Learning resources](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CNXPihvWEU)

## on mathematics
  * [Math for machine learning](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf) - free book
  * [Three blue one brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown) - fantastic video tutorials on youtube

## on neuroscience
### Books
  * [The Book of GENESIS](http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/bog/bog.html): a free book on neuroscience simulations in the context of the GENESIS simulator. Very readable introduction to computational neuroscience irrespective of the simulator
  * [Wulfram Gerstner's book](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/)

### Courses
  * [Wulfram Gerstner's course at EPFL](https://lcnwww.epfl.ch/gerstner/NeuronalDynamics-MOOCall.html)
  * [Robert Sapolsky's lectures on Human Behavioral Biology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNnIGh9g6fA&list=PL848F2368C90DDC3D)

### Simulators	
  * [MOOSE (Multi-scale Object Oriented Simulation Environment)](https://moose.ncbs.res.in): a general purpose simulation software for biology with focus on systems biology and neuroscience simulations. Inherits a lot from the GENESIS simulator.
  * [NEURON](https://neuron.yale.edu): another simulator with primary focus on neuronal models; added some systems biology capabilities in recent years.

### Databases
	
  * [Open Source Brain](http://www.opensourcebrain.org/): a public repository of neuronal models    
  * [neuromorpho.org](https://neuromorpho.org/): a public repository of neuronal morphologies	
  * [NeuroElectro](https://neuroelectro.org/): a public database of electrophysiological properties of various neurons  
  * [Allen Brain-Map](https://portal.brain-map.org/): multiple databases, from single cells to brain atlas
  * [Micron explorer](https://www.microns-explorer.org/): Allen Brain Institute portal with electron-microscopic reconstructions of mouse visual cortex circuitry
