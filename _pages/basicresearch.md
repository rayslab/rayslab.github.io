"It's of no use whatsoever. This is just an experiment that proves Maestro Maxwell was right - we just have these mysterious electromagnetic waves that we cannot see with the naked eye, but they are there."

*-- Heinrich Hertz*,

*when asked about the his experimental demonstration of electromagnetic waves*

Our primary focus is basic research (also called fundamental research), which is driven by curiosity and aimed at enhancing our knowledge of nature. We are frequently asked to justify the value of such work. However, it is impossible to predict what value a piece of knowledge will bring in the future. True research is about going after the unknown, and as Albert Einstein had put it "If we knew what it was we were doing, it would not be called research, would it?"

However, that hardly convinces the skeptics. Much has been written about the value of basic research, so instead of repeating these arguments, here is a list of articles on this topic:

- What is value? Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy on [Intrinsic and extrinsic value](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/value-intrinsic-extrinsic/)

- [A reddit post summarizing a lot of history and other sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/1anyor/comment/c8zfpkf/)

- [A piece in Symmetry magazine](https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/the-value-of-basic-research), in which Stefano Forte, a professor of theoretical physics at the University of Milan, is quoted about the Large Hadron Collider (LHC): *"The main goal is priceless and therefore has no price attached."*

- [The Usefulness of Useless Knowledge](https://www.ias.edu/ideas/2017/dijkgraaf-usefulness): A piece from Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton (this was the academic home of people like Albert Einstein, Kurt Goedel, John von Neumann, and Robert Oppenheimer) revisiting an essay by their founding director in 1939.
